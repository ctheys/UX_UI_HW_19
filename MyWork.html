            <h2><b>The Problem</b></h2>
            <p>Enthusiastic TV watchers with a daily desire for quality  viewing need an actionable way to select captivating shows and movies that are user-targeted while streaming on their subscribed platforms. Content options are broad, however it can take watchers a long time to make a decision  about what to watch, leading to wasted relaxation time.</p> 
            <h2><b>The Solution</b></h2>
            <p>The Solution: ‘Reelii’ is developing a mobile app to offer TV streamers  recommendations via friend’s sharing and by personal preferences.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="UserResearchTxt">
            <p>We began by discussing user viewing habits in 5 user interviews to understand  common frustrations with streaming services and how users decide on what  to watch. To compliment the user interviews we also conducted an online  survey that produced 35 responses. At the prototyping stage we were able to  do 8 user tests and iterate based on the feedback which resulted in the final  prototype. 
            The user interview plan was developed in order to obtain qualitative insights  on current consuming habits, pain points with available apps, and then to  further identify opportunities for ‘Reelii’ to solve the user problem. 
            A survey was then published on Facebook and Instagram and reached a total  of 35 participants. Questions within the survey were targeted at yielding  quantitative data and further supported results gathered from the user  interviews.  
            Key findings were as follows:</p></div>
            <div class="Stats">
                <div class="a">
                    <p>• 60% of the users use a streaming platform on a daily basis</p>
                </div>
                <div class="b">
                    <p>• 97% use Netflix.</p>

                <div class="c">
                    <p>• The vast array of choice on these platforms made it difficult for the  users to pick a movie/tv show.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="d">
                    <p>• On average, users would take 10 minutes to decide.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="e">
                    <p>• 74% have given up watching TV after not being able to decide.</p>

                <div class="f">
                    <p>• To help them narrow down the options, users would either use the genre filter or ask a friend for a recommendation.</p>
                </div>
        
                <p>Through our research, we discovered that there are a few direct competitors  within the landscape that had developed apps with some similar features to  ‘Reelii’.</p>

            <p>Making the right choice is the most important factor for users in enjoying their downtime and feeling like they have spent it in a meaningful way. Therefore this was the key feature to prioritize in designing the app.<br>
    
            Once the research insights had been synthesized, we were able to brainstorm potential ideas for the mobile app.<br>
    
            Categorizing these ideas into common themes, and then voting on them allowed us to prioritise the best solutions and features that needed to be incorporated into the platform.<br>
    
            Key features for high impact, and with low complexity are as follows:</p></div>
            <div class="g">
                <p>• Mood Filter</p>

                <p>A typical user scenario allowed us to fully map out the user flow as below.<br>
            
                A Guerilla user test plan was developed and then was run with 5 users initially.<br>

                Feedback comments were the following:</p>
                
                <div class="k">
                    <p>• ‘Watched’ button didn’t make sense as the user hadn’t watched the content yet.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="l">
                    <p>• Users queried whether you could stream directly from the app.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="m">
                    <p>• Language used was ambiguous - ‘Save’ and ‘My Watchlist’ used the same icon, and needed better differentiation.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="n">
                    <p>• Login screens weren’t aligned properly, and took users a second to adjust.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="o">
                    <p>• Liked the logo</p>
                </div>
                <div class="p">
                    <p>• Branding was fun!</p>
                </div>
                <br>
                
                <p>The user flow was then iterated once again in order to improve the language and overall flow, and we were then able to update the prototype to reflect the iOS Design System.</p>
            </div>  

            <div class="FinalPrototype">
                <h3>4 Final High Fidelity UI Prototype</h3>

                <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>

            <p>The research component was critical to providing fundamental insights that were rooted in empathy.<br>

                If we were to work on this project again, we would spend some more time user testing and then iterating again and again as needed. The feedback gathered from these tests were incredibly important and gave us a greater connection to our users and how they navigated the system.<br>
                
                User flow habits and trends need to be assessed better in future, as there are certain expectations that people have around this process. We could have saved time iterating if we had done a little more research  on that beforehand.<br>
